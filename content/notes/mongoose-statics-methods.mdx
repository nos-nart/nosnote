### What is the differences

+ **STATICS** are the methods defined on the Model.
+ **METHODS** are defined on the document (instance).

You might use a `static` method like `Animal.findByName`:

<CodeBlock language="js">{`
const fido = await Animal.findByName('fido');
// fido => { name: 'fido', type: 'dog' }
`}</CodeBlock>

And you might use an instance method like `fido.findSimilarTypes`:

<CodeBlock language="js">{`
const dogs = await fido.findSimilarTypes();
// dogs => [ {name:'fido',type:'dog} , {name:'sheeba',type:'dog'} ]
`}</CodeBlock>

But you wouldn't do `Animals.findSimilarTypes()` because `Animals` is a model, it has no "type". `findSimilarTypes` needs a `this.type` which wouldn't exist in `Animals` model, only a document instance would contain that property, as defined in the model.

Similarly you wouldn't do `fido.findByName` because `findByName` would need to search through all documents and fido is just a document.

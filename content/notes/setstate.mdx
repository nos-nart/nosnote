#### Why is setState giving me the wrong value?

In React, both `this.props` and `this.state` represent the rendered values, i.e. what‚Äôs currently on the screen.
<br/>

Calls to `setState` are `asynchronous` - don‚Äôt rely on this.state to reflect the new value immediately after calling setState. Pass an updater function instead of an object if you need to compute values based on the current state (see below for details).

<br/>

Example of code that will not behave as expected:

<br/>

```js
incrementCount() {
  // Note: this will *not* work as intended.
  this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1});
}

handleSomething() {
  // Let's say `this.state.count` starts at 0.
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  // When React re-renders the component, `this.state.count` will be 1, but you expected 3.

  // This is because `incrementCount()` function above reads from `this.state.count`,
  // but React doesn't update `this.state.count` until the component is re-rendered.
  // So `incrementCount()` ends up reading `this.state.count` as 0 every time, and sets it to 1.

  // The fix is described below!
}
```

#### How do I update state with values that depend on the current state?

Pass a function instead of an object to `setState` to ensure the call always uses the most updated version of state (see below).

#### What is the difference between passing an object or a function in setState?

Passing an update function allows you to access the current state value inside the updater. Since `setState` calls are batched, this lets you chain updates and ensure they build on top of each other instead of conflicting:

<br/>

```js
incrementCount() {
  this.setState((state) => {
    // Important: read `state` instead of `this.state` when updating.
    return {count: state.count + 1}
  });
}

handleSomething() {
  // Let's say `this.state.count` starts at 0.
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();

  // If you read `this.state.count` now, it would still be 0.
  // But when React re-renders the component, it will be 3.
}
```

#### When is setState asynchronous?

Currently, `setState` is asynchronous inside event handlers.

<br/>

This ensures, for example, that if both `Parent` and `Child` call `setState` during a click event, `Child` isn‚Äôt re-rendered twice. Instead, React ‚Äúflushes‚Äù the state updates at the end of the browser event. This results in significant performance improvements in larger apps.

<br/>

This is an implementation detail so avoid relying on it directly. In the future versions, React will batch updates by default in more cases.

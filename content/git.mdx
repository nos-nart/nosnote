### git squash commit
For example you wanna squash 2 commits into one

1. **reset**
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~2
git commit -m "new commit message"
git push --force-with-lease
```

<br/>

**Scenario:** You branch `feature/A` checkout from `dev`. Before create pull request into dev you wanna squash all commit of feature/A into one
```bash
git reset origin/dev
// M·∫•t s·∫°ch commit, c√°c files tr·ªü v·ªÅ tr·∫°ng th√°i modified
// branch v·ªÅ tr·∫°ng th√°i nh∆∞ tr√™n dev
git status
git add <your_modified_files>
git commit <your_new_message>
git push --force-with-lease
```

2. **rebase**

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~2

pick 71e78f7 [+] dd                   // the target commit
squash 5e7a8d0 [+] ff                 // squash into the target

# Rebase ea854db..5e7a8d0 onto ea854db (2 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')

:wq                                   // save and quit

git push --force-with-lease
```

**Scenario**: You're working on feature/A checkout from dev, with N issues arise you have N commit to your branch. You can squash your commit by **rebase**

```bash
git rebase -i dev

pick 380d5e1 release feature/A
squash 30803a6 fix iss1
squash 30803a2 fix iss2
squash 30803a5 fix iss3
squash 380d5e1 fix iss4

# Rebase 380d5e1..5e7a8d0 onto 380d5e1 (2 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
```
